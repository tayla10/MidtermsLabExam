# 🧪 Midterm Lab Exam – Simple Login Project


## 📁 Project Overview

This is a basic web development project that simulates a simple login system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to practice both frontend development and Git version control in a real-world scenario.

## ✅ What I Did

- Created a **login page** using HTML with email and password input fields
- Added **JavaScript validation** to make sure both fields are not empty
- Styled the page with **external CSS**
- Made a **homepage** that users are redirected to after login
- Used **Git commands** to track every step of development
- Created and merged a branch with a simple navigation bar
- Uploaded everything to **GitHub**

## 🛠️ Folder Structure

LabExam_LastName_FirstName/
├── index.html ← login page
├── home.html ← homepage (after login)
├── style.css ← custom styling
├── script.js ← form validation + redirection
└── README.md ← this file


## 🎯 How It Works

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Enter any email and password (no strict checking).
3. If both fields are filled, the form redirects to `home.html` that consists of navigation bars /Home/Profile/Logout but among them Logout is the only on working.
4. The homepage simply displays a welcome message.
